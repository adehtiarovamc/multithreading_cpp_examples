## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adehtiarovamc/multithreading-stl-examples.git
    cd multithreading-stl-examples
    ```

2. **Compile the examples (Using Visual C++)**:
    Each example is provided with its own Makefile. Navigate to the example directory and run:
    ```bash
    mkdir bin
    cd .\bin\
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

3. **Run the examples**:
    After compiling, you can run each example by executing the generated binary:
    ```bash
    ./[file_name].exe
    ```
